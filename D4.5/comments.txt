- deleting value from dict? Maybe jinja?

- node thing -> if ability to engage caching this would be handled automatically
- calcjob -> consistency: calcjobs calcfunction and workchain would all be handled identically
 --> maybe use "process" or something similar to capture everything
- look at ansible to see how they handle while loops
- Potentially add some context stuff into the error message.
- Some error code handling logic? Could probably be done already with current primitives
